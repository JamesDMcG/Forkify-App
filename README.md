Forkify App

The Forkify App is a recipe journal and search engine designed to fetch, manage, and display recipes from an external API. Built with modern JavaScript, it includes robust state management and modular components.

Techniques and Features
- Async/Await for Fetch API: Handles API requests asynchronously ([MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)).
- Local Storage: Saves favorite recipes to persist data ([MDN Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)).

Technologies and Libraries
- SCSS: Styles the app with modular, nested syntax ([SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)).
- Font Awesome: Provides icons throughout the UI ([Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)).
